# 🏗️ Assignment 1 & 🎭 Activity 2 – Python OOP Practice

## 📘 Description

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using **custom classes**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## 🦸‍♂️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

### ✔️ Features:
- A `Superhero` base class with attributes like name, power, and level.
- A subclass `FlyingSuperhero` adds a new attribute (`flight_speed`) using **encapsulation** (private variable).
- The `show_identity()` method is overridden in the subclass using **inheritance and polymorphism**.

---

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

### ✔️ Features:
- A base class `Vehicle` with a method `move()`.
- Subclasses `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` override `move()` with different behaviors:
  - Car: `"Driving 🚗"`
  - Plane: `"Flying ✈️"`
  - Boat: `"Sailing 🚢"`

Demonstrates **polymorphism** by treating all vehicles the same but triggering different behavior.
